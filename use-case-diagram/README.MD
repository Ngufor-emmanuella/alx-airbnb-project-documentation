#### User: Represents guests and hosts.
#### Admin: Represents the administrator of the system.

In this project, I design a flow chart using draw.io which displays the various interactions between the back end components like
### User management
which controls the user's Registration, login and profile

### Property Listings / management
which controls how the user does crud operations that is add, edit, update and delete

### Booking system
It ensures the user easilys books for services in the application, and shows when the boking was created, cancellation of the booking and over all status of the booking

### Payment Intergration
Makes sure users can make payment on the app, using some payment gate ways like pay pal or stripe and it also ensures the currency the payments will be made in 


### Notifications
Ensures emails and other notifications are properly implemented in the application
